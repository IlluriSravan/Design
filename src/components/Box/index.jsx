        <p>Celebrating 100 years</p>
        <h3>100 years have passed</h3>
        <p>100 years have passed since our founders created what is now the Novo Nordisk Foundation. We are sure they would find todayâ€™s world a much better place than the one they lived in.</p>

        <p>As we mark our centennial, the Novo Nordisk Foundation reaffirms its commitment to being a catalyst for better human and planetary health. We are mindful of the responsibilities that come with being a resourceful organization. We pledge to be transparent about our work, involve our stakeholders in shaping our strategies, and address the concerns that some may have with the science and technologies that we support. Only this way can we earn the trust of our stakeholders and make a meaningful impact, together.</p>
